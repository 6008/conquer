# conquer

This repository contains the code for the *conquer* (**con**sistent **qu**antification of **e**xternal **R**NA-seq data sets) repository, which provides access to consistently processed, analysis-ready single-cell RNA-seq data sets, together with quality control and exploratory analysis reports to help the user determine whether a particular data set fits their purposes. 

The repository is available at [http://imlspenticton.uzh.ch:3838/conquer/](http://imlspenticton.uzh.ch:3838/conquer/). A more detailed description of the workflow that was used to process the data is available within the application (see the "About" tab), or [here](shiny-download/about_conquer.md).
